# Lab5

This is my fifth lab assignment for CISC 3130. This Repository contains the following: three CSV files containing spotify global list of week 10/09/2020-10/23/2020, Main Lab5.java program that sorts the list of files alphabetically based on the title, OutputText file Artist-WeekOf10022020.txt which is the output file of the report.

This java program prints out in alphabetical order the title of a song, artist's name, and stream count.
